# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, where elements are inserted and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack.

## Characteristics

- **Ordered Collection**: Elements in a stack are ordered based on when they were added, with the most recently added element positioned at the top.
- **Dynamic Size**: Stacks can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are pushed or popped.
- **Restricted Access**: Stacks typically support operations like push (addition) and pop (removal) but do not allow random access to elements in the middle.

## Advantages

- **LIFO Behavior**: Stacks enforce LIFO behavior, making them suitable for scenarios where the order of processing matters, such as function call stack in programming.
- **Dynamic Size**: Stacks can grow or shrink dynamically, accommodating varying numbers of elements.
- **Simple Implementation**: Stacks have a straightforward implementation and are supported by most programming languages.

## Disadvantages

- **Limited Access**: Stacks do not support random access to elements; only the top element can be accessed or removed at any given time.
- **Overhead**: Implementing certain stack operations, like popping from the top, may involve shifting elements, leading to performance overhead.
- **No Priority**: Stacks do not prioritize elements based on any criteria; they strictly follow the LIFO principle.

## Common Operations

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **getSize**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Average | Worst Case |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Access    | O(n)    | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(n)    | O(n)       |
| Push      | O(1)    | O(1)       |
| Pop       | O(1)    | O(1)       |

## Use Cases

- **Function Call Stack**: Stacks are commonly used in programming languages to manage function calls and local variables.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used in evaluating expressions, such as infix, postfix, or prefix notation.
- **Backtracking**: Stacks are employed in algorithms that involve backtracking, such as depth-first search (DFS).

## Considerations

- **Static vs. Dynamic Stacks**: Depending on the application requirements, developers may choose between static or dynamic stack implementations to manage memory efficiently.
- **Concurrency**: In multi-threaded environments, proper synchronization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying stacks.
- **Performance**: Developers should be mindful of potential performance overhead, especially when dealing with large stacks or frequent push and pop operations.

Stacks are fundamental data structures used in various scenarios such as function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms. While they offer benefits like LIFO behavior and dynamic size, developers should consider their limitations and performance implications when integrating stacks into their applications.
