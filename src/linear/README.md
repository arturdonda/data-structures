# Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures are arrangements of data elements where each element is connected to its previous and next element in a linear order. These structures are characterized by their simplicity and ease of implementation, making them fundamental building blocks in computer science and programming.

Linear data structures are:

- **[Array](/src/linear/array/)**: Arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. They offer constant-time access to elements using their index positions, making them efficient for random access operations.
- **[Linked List](/src/linear/linked-list/)**: Linked lists are collections of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. They offer dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations, but access time to elements is linear.
- **[Queue](/src/linear/queue/)**: First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structures that support two main operations: enqueue (adding an element to the rear) and dequeue (removing the front element).
- **[Stack](/src/linear/stack/)**: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structures that support two main operations: push (inserting an element) and pop (removing the top element).

## Usage

Linear data structures are widely used in various programming scenarios, including:

- **Data Storage**: Arrays and linked lists are commonly used for storing and organizing data elements in memory.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Stacks and queues are essential for implementing algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Buffer Management**: Queues are often used to manage buffers in data processing systems, ensuring orderly access to resources.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are instrumental in evaluating arithmetic expressions and implementing algorithms like infix to postfix conversion.

Understanding when and how to use linear data structures is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and building robust software applications.
