# Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-linear data structures are arrangements of data elements where each element can be connected to multiple other elements, forming complex relationships. Unlike linear data structures, non-linear structures do not follow a strict order, allowing for more flexible and diverse representations of data.

non-linear data structures are:

- **[Graph](./graph/)**: Non-linear data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges, where each edge connects two vertices. Graphs are versatile structures usually used to model networks.
- **[Hash Table](./hash-table/)**: Hash tables are data structures that implement associative arrays or mappings, where data elements are stored in an array and accessed using keys. Hash tables offer constant-time average case complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, making them efficient for storing and retrieving data.
- **[Heap](./heap/)**: Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property, where each parent node is either greater than or less than its child nodes. Heaps are commonly used in priority queues and sorting algorithms such as heap sort.
- **[Tree](./tree/)**: Hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has a parent-child relationship with other nodes. Trees are widely used for organizing hierarchical data such as file systems, organizational charts, and XML/HTML documents.

## Usage

Non-linear data structures are essential for modeling complex relationships and representing diverse types of data. They are commonly used in the following scenarios:

- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships between entities, such as categories in a directory structure or components in a software architecture.
- **Network Modeling**: Graphs are used to model relationships between entities in networks, such as connections between computers in a network infrastructure or friendships between users in a social network.
- **Priority Queue**: Heaps are used to implement priority queues, where elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority.
- **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Hash tables are used for efficient storage and retrieval of data, such as implementing symbol tables in compilers or databases.

Understanding non-linear data structures is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and building complex software systems that accurately model real-world relationships and solve challenging problems.
