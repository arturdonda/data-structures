# Generic Tree

A generic tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have an **arbitrary number of child nodes**. Unlike binary trees, which restrict each node to having at most two children, generic trees do not have such limitations.

## Use Cases

- **File Systems**: The hierarchical organization of files and folders in an operating system is typically represented as a generic tree. Each folder can contain multiple files and subfolders, reflecting the arbitrary number of children nodes in a generic tree.
- **Company Hierarchy**: In a corporate environment, the hierarchical structure of the organization, where each manager can have multiple subordinates, can be modeled using a generic tree. The root node represents the CEO, and each subsequent level represents different tiers of management and employees.
- **XML/HTML Document Representation**: XML and HTML documents are structured as trees. Each element in the document can contain other elements, attributes, and text, forming a hierarchical structure that can be traversed and manipulated.
- **Product Categorization**: E-commerce platforms use generic trees to categorize products. For example, a category like "Electronics" can have subcategories like "Computers", "Mobile Phones", and "Cameras", each of which can have further subcategories.
