# Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures & Algorithms repository!

This repository is dedicated to documenting my studies on Data Structures and Algorithms. DSA is the backbone of software engineering, and learning it is essential for mastering problem-solving, optimizing algorithms, enhancing scalability, and laying a solid foundation for advanced computer science topics.

> DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.

## What is Data Structures & Algorithms?

Data structures are organizational formats used to store and manage data effectively. They define the way data is organized, stored, and accessed in computer memory. Understanding data structures is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and developing scalable software solutions.

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal. They define the logic and sequence of operations required to manipulate data stored in various data structures. Proficiency in algorithms enables engineers to develop efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.

Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, and algorithms are not worth much without a data structure to work on.

## Classification

### Data Structures

- [**Linear Data Structures**](/src/linear): elements are arranged in one dimension (for example lists, stack, queue)
  - **Arrays**: Basic storage structure for elements of the same type.
  - **Linked Lists**: Linear data structures consisting of nodes.
  - **Stacks**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structures.
  - **Queues**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structures.
- [**Non-Linear Data Structures**](/src/non-linear): elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions (for example tree, graph, table)
  - **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures with nodes.
  - **Graphs**: Non-linear data structures composed of nodes and edges.
  - **Hash Tables**: Data structures that implement associative arrays or mappings.

### Algorithms

- **Searching Algorithms**: Techniques for finding an element or group of elements in a collection.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Techniques for arranging elements in a specific order.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms for traversing or manipulating graphs.
- **String Algorithms**: Techniques for processing and manipulating strings.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimization method that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
